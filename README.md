# ffn_implementation
Experiment with forward forward network, adapted from repo https://github.com/mohammadpz/pytorch_forward_forward

Current implementation replaces linear layers with convolutional layers, reaching a nearly 80% accuracy on MNIST. More careful design and hyperparameter tuning is still needed.
